I also got cheesy fries desperately to try and although there was plenty of cheese, the cheese was disgusting, DISGUSTING. It was plastic cheese often found on a burger melted with a dollop of tasteless sour cream. Note to self don't get anything with \"cheese\" on again. On the up side there was bottomless soft drinks! That watered down the foul taste of the cheese you fries. The churros where... alright even though they are traditionally Spanish and taco bell is Mexican.

I also got cheesy fries desperately to try and although there was plenty of cheese, the cheese was disgusting, DISGUSTING. It was plastic cheese often found on a burger melted with a dollop of tasteless sour cream. Note to self don't get anything with \"cheese\" on again. On the up side there was bottomless soft drinks! That watered down the foul taste of the cheese you fries. The churros where... alright even though they are traditionally Spanish and taco bell is Mexican. In conclusion, I would give more stars due to a good atmosphere however the disappointing food let it down a lot. I expected good things but in the end I reached an anticlimactic solution. Go to taco bell but only if you like these very Americanly adapted flavours.",
